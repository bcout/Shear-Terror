# Shear-Terror
Shear Terror is 3D third person runner about a sheep fleeing from a farmer trying to shear it. Fortunately, the sheep knows parkour and easily escapes the den. Play as the sheep and flee from the farmer through multiple levels, protecting the only valuable thing you have â€“ the fleece on your back!

## Features  
Randomly generated levels  
Do flips and tricks when jumping over obstacles  
Flail around as a ragdoll if you hit an obstacle or fail a trick  

Made in a few months as a game programming project, so enjoy it, but don't take it too seriously!
