# Shear-Terror
A 3D game made in Unity

## TODO
See [Issues](https://github.com/bcout/Shear-Terror/issues) for work that needs to be done.

## Assets from the Asset Store
Instead of pushing a ton of assets onto this repo, we will each import the same assets from the asset store locally. 

Create a folder in `/Assets/` named `/AssetStore/` and place all imported assets into that folder. The .gitignore excludes this folder, so it won't be pushed with the rest of your work.

## Game Design Document

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/bcout/Shear-Terror/wiki) for the game design document.
